      <h2>Rules for play:</h2>
      <h1><strong>Game Overview:</strong></h1>
      <p>This game is a strategic card game that uses standard playing cards, including Jokers. The main objective is to collect sets of four cards and strategically utilize Jokers, which can instantly represent a set of four.</p>
      <h2><strong>Game Setup:</strong></h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Deck Composition</strong>: Two standard 54-card decks (including Jokers) are used.</li>
        <li><strong>Players</strong>: 2 to 10 players can participate. The game accommodates both AI and human players.</li>
        <li><strong>Starting Hands</strong>: Players begin with 12 cards if there are 2 players, or 10 cards if more than 2 players are playing.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Game Play:</h2>
      <h3>1. <strong>Shuffling and Dealing</strong>:</h3>
      <p>Begin by shuffling the deck thoroughly and dealing the determined number of cards to each player.</p>
      <h3>2. <strong>Turns</strong>:</h3>
      <p>Players take turns in a clockwise direction. Each turn consists of a drawing phase, a playing phase, and a discarding phase.</p>
      <h3>3. <strong>Drawing Cards</strong>:</h3>
      <p>Players may draw two cards from the deck or one card from the discard pile on their turn. Opting for cards from the discard pile is a strategic move that can reveal what a player might be trying to collect.</p>
      <h3>4. <strong>Playing Sets</strong>:</h3>
      <p>A set consists of four cards of the same rank. Jokers are powerful, acting as a complete set on their own (equivalent to four identical cards). Players announce sets to accumulate points.</p>
      <h3>5. <strong>Discarding</strong>:</h3>
      <p>If unable to play a set, players must discard a card to the central discard pile, which is visible to all players.</p>
      <h3>6. <strong>Jokers as Instant Sets</strong>:</h3>
      <p>Jokers can be declared as an instant set, dramatically influencing the state of the game. They can also be used to claim the discard pile, providing a significant strategic advantage.</p>
      <h3>7. <strong>Jokester Calls</strong>:</h3>
      <p>A "Jokester" declaration allows a player to claim the discard pile using either a set of four, a Joker, or a bluff. Other players can challenge this declaration, and incorrect challenges result in discarding two card as a penalty.</p>
      <h2><strong>Winning the Game:</strong></h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The game ends when the deck is exhausted.</li>
        <li>The player with the highest number of sets at the end wins. Collecting four Jokers enables a player to win immediately.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2><strong>Special Rules:</strong></h2>
      <p><strong>Bluffing and Challenges</strong>: Bluffing is an integral part of the game. Players may bluff in their Jokester calls, leading to strategic decisions and challenges from opponents.</p>
      <h2><strong>Strategy Tips:</strong></h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Keep an eye on the discard pile to predict other players' strategies.</li>
        <li>Use Jokers wisely, as they can be game-changing.</li>
        <li>Keep track of which cards have been played to better anticipate the remaining deck composition.</li>
      </ul>
